`@rlanz/bull-queue` is a queue system based on [BullMQ](https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq)
for [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/).

> You must have a Redis server running on your machine.

## Getting Started

This package is available in the npm registry.

```bash
npm install @rlanz/bull-queue
```

Next, configure the package by running the following command.

```bash
node ace configure @rlanz/bull-queue
```

and... Voil√†!

## Usage

The `Queue` provider gives you access to the `dispatch` method.
It will dispatch the linked job to the queue with the given payload.

```ts
import { Queue } from '@ioc:Rlanz/Queue';

Queue.dispatch('App/Jobs/RegisterStripeCustomer', {...});

Queue.dispatch('App/Jobs/RegisterStripeCustomer', {...}, {
  queueName: 'stripe',
});
```

You can create a job by running `node ace make:job {job}`.
This will create the job within your `app/Jobs` directory.

The `handle` method is what gets called when the jobs is processed while
the `failed` method is called when the max attempts of the job has been reached.

You can remove the `failed` method if you choose as the processor checks if the method exists.
Since the job instance is passed to the constructor, you can easily send notifications with the `failed` method. See [this page](https://api.docs.bullmq.io/classes/Job.html) for full documentation on the job instance.

Example job file:

```ts
// app/Jobs/RegisterStripeCustomer.ts
import type { JobHandlerContract, Job } from '@ioc:Rlanz/Queue';

export type RegisterStripeCustomerPayload = {
  userId: string;
};

export default class RegisterStripeCustomer implements JobHandlerContract {
  constructor(public job: Job) {
    this.job = job;
  }

  public async handle(payload: RegisterStripeCustomerPayload) {
    // ...
  }

  /**
   * This is an optional method that gets called if it exists when the retries has exceeded and is marked failed.
   */
  public async failed() {}
}
```

#### Job Attempts

By default, all jobs have a retry of 3 and this is set within your `config/queue.ts` under the `jobs` object.

You can also set the attempts on a call basis by passing the overide as shown below:

```ts
Queue.dispatch('App/Jobs/Somejob', {...}, { attempts: 3 })
```

#### Delayed retries

If you need to add delays inbetween retries, you can either set it globally via by adding this to your `config/queue.ts`:

```ts
// config/queue.ts
  ...
  jobs: {
    attempts: 3,
    backoff: {
      type: 'exponential',
      delay: 5000,
    },
  }
```

Or... you can also do it per job:

```ts
Queue.dispatch('App/Jobs/Somejob', {...}, {
  attempts: 3,
  backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 5000 }
})
```

With that configuration above, BullMQ will first add a 5s delay before the first retry, 20s before the 2nd, and 40s for the 3rd.

You can visit [this page](https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/retrying-failing-jobs) on further explanation / other retry options.

#### Running the queue

Run the queue worker with the following ace command:

```bash
node ace queue:listen

# or

node ace queue:listen --queue=stripe

# or

node ace queue:listen --queue=stripe,cloudflare
```

Once done, you will see the message `Queue processing started`.

## Typings

You can define the payload's type for a given job inside the `contracts/queue.ts` file.

```ts
import type { RegisterStripeCustomerPayload } from 'App/Jobs/RegisterStripeCustomer';

declare module '@ioc:Setten/Queue' {
  interface JobsList {
    'App/Jobs/RegisterStripeCustomer': RegisterStripeCustomerPayload;
  }
}
```
